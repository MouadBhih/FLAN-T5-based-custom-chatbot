# FLAN-T5 Custom Chatbot

This repository contains a custom chatbot implementation using the FLAN-T5 model. The chatbot leverages the FLAN-T5 architecture to deliver natural language processing capabilities, providing responses to various user inputs.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an interactive chatbot using the FLAN-T5 model, a variant of the T5 model optimized for few-shot learning and natural language understanding. This chatbot can be easily adapted for different use cases by modifying its input data and training parameters.
